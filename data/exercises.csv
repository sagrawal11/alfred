The movement is to bring the arms up in front of the body to eye level and with only a slight bend in the elbow. This isolates the anterior deltoid muscle (front of the shoulder) and uses the anterior deltoid to lift the weight. When lifting it is important to keep the body still so the anterior deltoid is fully utilised; if the weight cannot be lifted by standing still then it is too heavy and a lower weight is needed. It is important to keep a slight bend in the elbow when lifting as keeping the elbow locked will add stress to the elbow joint and could cause injury. A neutral grip, similar to that used in the hammer curl, can also be used. With this variation the weight is again raised to eye level, but out to a 45 degree angle from the front of the body. This may be beneficial for those with shoulder injuries, particularly those related to the rotator cuff.""]","[]","[]","[]","wger"

When the bar approaches the upper chest, the wrists are swiftly flexed to bring the forearms above the bar. The body is leaned forward, and the elbows are straightened by activating the triceps. The routine is considered complete when the bar is at the level of the waist and the arms are fully straight. To dismount, the arms are bent at the elbow, and the body is lowered to the floor, and the exercise can be repeated. As a relatively advanced exercise, muscle-ups are typically first learned with an assistive kip. The legs swing (kip) up and provide momentum to assist in the explosive upward force needed to ascend above the bar. More advanced athletes can perform a strict variation of the muscle-up which is done slowly, without any kip.

To perform a parallettes push-up, assume a push-up position with your hands on the parallettes and your feet on the ground. Lower your body towards the ground while keeping your elbows close to your sides, and then push back up to the starting position. Parallettes push-ups place more emphasis on the chest and shoulders compared to traditional push-ups, as they allow for a greater range of motion in the shoulder joint. This increased range of motion can also help to improve shoulder stability and mobility. Additionally, parallettes push-ups engage the core muscles more than traditional push-ups, as the instability of the parallettes requires greater activation of the core muscles to maintain proper form. The added challenge of balancing on the parallettes also requires greater upper body strength and control, making parallettes push-ups a more advanced variation of the traditional push-up. They can be a great way to challenge yourself and add variety to your upper body workout routine.

Starting Position: Hang with arms fully extended, engaging your core and keeping your shoulder blades pulled down.3. The Pull: Pull your body up towards one hand, similar to a regular pull-up. At the same time, extend the other arm out to the side, keeping it as straight as possible. Your chin should come towards the hand that is pulling.4. Hold &amp; Lower: Briefly hold the top position where one arm is bent and pulling, and the other is extended. Slowly lower yourself back to the starting position with control.5. Alternate: Repeat the movement, pulling up towards the opposite hand.The key to this exercise is to keep the assisting arm as straight as possible to maximise the load on the working arm.

It offers multiple benefits, such as the ability to easily adjust speed and incline, allowing for a variety of workouts, from hill walking to high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and tempo runs. To optimize results, it's important to vary your workouts. Benefits of Treadmill Cardio: - Improved Cardiovascular Health: Regular aerobic exercise on a treadmill strengthens the heart and lungs, which can help prevent heart disease. - Weight Loss: By burning calories, treadmill training can be an effective tool for weight loss and maintaining a healthy weight. - Muscle Strengthening: It strengthens the muscles in the legs and glutes, helping to prevent muscle loss, which is especially important with age. - Training Flexibility: Allows you to vary speed, incline, and intervals, making your workout more dynamic and adaptable to different fitness levels. Types of Treadmill Training: - Hill Walking: Increasing the incline of the treadmill and walking at a brisk pace can improve endurance and work your leg muscles. - Endurance Jog: A run at a comfortable, steady pace that keeps your heart rate in a target zone (such as Zone 2) to build endurance. - Interval Training: Alternating periods of high intensity (fast running) with periods of low intensity (easy walking or jogging) to maximize calorie burn and cardiovascular improvement. - Tempo Run: A run at a steady, sustained pace that is slightly faster than a normal jog, which challenges your ability to sustain a more intense effort for an extended period.""]","[]","[]","[]","wger"
