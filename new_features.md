1. ✅ "What just happened?" Mode

This feature lets you offload mental bookkeeping by responding intelligently when you're vague or exhausted. If you text something like "just finished" or "done," the assistant replies with a short numbered list of likely interpretations (workout, task, meal, call, etc.), allowing you to confirm with a single digit. Over time, it learns which options you usually mean in certain contexts (e.g., "done" after the gym usually means workout), reducing how often it needs to ask. This is especially valuable after workouts, late nights, or busy moments when precision feels like friction.

2. ✅ Smart Reminder Follow-Ups

Instead of reminders being fire-and-forget, the assistant treats them as open loops that deserve closure. When a reminder triggers and you don't reply, the bot checks back after a configurable delay with a gentle follow-up like "Did you get a chance to call mom, or should I reschedule it?" This prevents reminders from silently failing and reduces the guilt of ignoring them, while still keeping you in control. The tone can adapt based on your historical behavior (short, neutral, or encouraging).

3. ✅ Auto-Reschedule Missed Tasks

If a reminder time passes with no completion message, the assistant proactively suggests a sensible reschedule rather than forcing you to reissue the command later. For example, a missed evening reminder might prompt "Want me to move this to tomorrow morning or later today?" with quick-reply-style options. This minimizes task abandonment and makes your system feel supportive instead of punitive, especially for recurring or time-sensitive tasks.

4. ✅ Task Decay & Cleanup

To prevent your todo list from becoming an ignored archive, the assistant periodically reviews stale tasks and checks whether they're still relevant. If a task hasn't been touched in several days, it sends a low-pressure message like "Still want 'buy groceries' on your list?" with options to keep, reschedule, or delete. This keeps your task list lightweight and meaningful, and reinforces trust that the system won't quietly accumulate clutter behind the scenes.

5. ✅ Weekly SMS Digest

Once a week, the assistant sends a compact summary of your behavior and progress across tracked domains: water intake averages, gym frequency, food patterns, and task completion rates. The digest is designed to be skimmable in under 30 seconds, offering insight without requiring dashboards or apps. This passive reflection builds self-awareness and habit reinforcement, turning raw logs into actionable understanding with zero effort on your part.

6. “Why Am I Tired?” Query

This feature lets you ask high-level, human questions rather than querying individual stats. When you text “why do I feel tired,” the assistant correlates recent data like low water intake, skipped meals, heavy workouts, or poor sleep patterns (if tracked) and responds with a short explanation grounded in your actual behavior. This creates a strong sense of payoff for logging habits and makes the assistant feel genuinely helpful rather than just a recorder.

7. Mood / Energy Check-Ins

You can casually log subjective states like “felt tired today” or “felt good after gym,” which the assistant stores alongside objective data. Over time, it can surface correlations between mood, food, hydration, workouts, and workload, helping you understand what actually affects your energy and well-being. Because the input is lightweight and optional, it avoids the burden of formal mood tracking while still enabling meaningful insight later.

8. ✅ Gentle Nudges (Not Reminders)

Instead of blunt alerts, the assistant sends context-aware nudges that reference your personal patterns rather than absolute goals. For example, "You're one bottle behind your usual pace today" feels informative and non-judgmental compared to "Drink water now." These nudges are harder to ignore emotionally but easier to accept, and they reduce alert fatigue by framing guidance as helpful context rather than commands.

9. Natural Language Planning

This feature allows you to plan and reason about your schedule conversationally, using phrases like "Block two hours tomorrow to study" or "Am I free Friday afternoon?" The assistant reads your Google Calendar, summarizes availability, and optionally creates reminders or holds. It turns scheduling into dialogue rather than a UI task, which is especially powerful over SMS when you're away from your computer or mentally overloaded.

10. ✅ "What Should I Do Now?"

When you ask this, the assistant synthesizes your current context — time of day, upcoming calendar events, open todos, and even inferred energy levels — to suggest a short list of sensible next actions. This reduces decision fatigue during unstructured time and makes the assistant feel like a real-life executive function aid. Importantly, it suggests rather than dictates, preserving autonomy while offering clarity.

11. ✅ Undo & Edit via SMS

Because SMS is fast and error-prone, this feature gives you safety and confidence by allowing corrections after the fact. Commands like "undo last," "edit last food," or "delete reminder" let you fix mistakes without hunting through files or reissuing complex commands. This dramatically lowers the cost of logging imperfectly, encouraging more consistent use and making the system feel forgiving rather than brittle.

12. ✅ Sleep Tracker (Minimal, Assistant-Oriented)

The sleep tracker is designed to capture just enough information to be useful without becoming a habit-tracking burden. You log sleep with simple, low-friction messages like "slept at 1:30" and "up at 8," or optionally a single message like "slept 1:30–8." The assistant stores only timestamps, computes duration, and uses that data strictly for factual recall and context-aware assistance (e.g., answering "how much did I sleep last night?" or adjusting reminder timing if you're still asleep). It does not comment on sleep quality, give advice, or send nudges; its role is purely to maintain an accurate, queryable sleep history so you don't have to remember or reconstruct it later. The feature succeeds when logging takes under 5 seconds and retrieving sleep data feels instant and reliable.

13. ✅ Information Recall (Personal Facts Memory)

Information recall turns your SMS assistant into a lightweight, searchable memory for small but important facts that are annoying to re-find. You can text things like "WiFi password is duke-guest-2025," "Locker code 4312," "Parking spot B17," or "Dentist is Dr. Patel," and the assistant stores these as structured key–value facts rather than notes or journal entries. Later, you can retrieve them naturally with queries like "what's the WiFi password?" or "where did I park?" without scrolling through messages or apps. You can also list all stored facts with "list all facts" and delete facts with "delete [fact name]". Facts are editable and deletable via SMS, and optionally scoped by context (home, campus, apartment) to avoid clutter. The value comes from reliability and speed: the assistant becomes the first place you ask when you know you once knew something but don't want to think about where it's written down.

14. ✅ Food Suggestion Engine (Constraint-Based)

This feature lets you ask simple, goal-oriented questions like "what should I eat?", "something high in protein," or "high protein and low calories," and receive a short list of concrete food suggestions pulled from your existing food database and past logs. Instead of generic nutrition advice, the assistant filters foods by explicit constraints (macros, calories, restaurant/location tags, time of day if relevant) and returns 3–5 options ranked by how well they match the request. If context is available, it can prioritize foods you've eaten before, foods you're likely to have access to (e.g., dining hall vs. home), or foods that fit remaining daily macros. The response is intentionally concise and actionable — names, macros, and nothing else — so you can decide quickly or follow up with "log option 2." The value of this feature is that it eliminates decision overhead at the moment you're hungry by converting vague intent into concrete, loggable options in one SMS exchange.
